Binary/Executable Installer to the system binary directory.

If you created an executable, you confirmed that it works.

Then you can install it directly to the system to run it when you need it,                                            
Without having to go directory by directory to the terminal, and run it.

                                                           

Currently it is only available in Spanish, as it is my native language.

Soon I will launch translation to the English language.

The executable and the "source" file with the program code are in Spanish.


If you wish to make the program available in some other language,

 and are willing to help with the translation, you will be duly thanked,

 with credits to the program and the repository.
